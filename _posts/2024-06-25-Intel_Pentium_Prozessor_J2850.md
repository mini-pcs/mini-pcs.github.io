## Introduction to Low-Powered Desktop Chips
---------------------------------------------------

In recent times, I've had a fascination with low-powered desktop chips like the A6 5200. While they may not be great for gaming or heavy workloads, they can still run various cool services like Plex, Helma Assistant, or Trunas while using minimal power. This sparked an interest in comparing them to similar offerings from other manufacturers.

## The Intel Pentium J Series Processors
---------------------------------------------

I had a few people recommend some Intel Pentium J series processors, which made me want to get one and compare it to the AMD offering from around the same time period. In this video, I'll be exploring an HP motherboard featuring an embedded Intel J2850 processor.

## Unboxing and Assembly
---------------------------

The HP 776903-001 motherboard is a real mystery, as there's poor documentation about its exact model. However, after researching the Intel ARC website and HP's own product listings, I'm confident that this features an Intel J2850 processor. This chip uses sodium slots instead of typical DIMS, has two PCIe by one slots, and one PCI slot.

## Testing and Troubleshooting
-------------------------------

After setting up the motherboard with a Gigabyte 650-watt power supply (don't worry, it's not one of those exploding ones!), an A-Data 128GB boot drive, and a handy dandy monitor, I tried to boot it up and got... nothing! No post screen, no beeps, nothing. Despite trying different RAM configurations, swapping out the entire motherboard, and attempting to reset the CMOS, I couldn't get it to work.

## Conclusion
--------------

As you might expect, this video didn't exactly go as planned. Despite my best efforts, the board remained uncooperative. However, I wanted to be honest and transparent with all of my content, so here's a lesson in buying used hardware: sometimes things don't work as expected.

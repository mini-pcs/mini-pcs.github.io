Imagine holding a true masterpiece of ergonomic design. With an 8-inch Pure Sight display and a 144 Hz refresh rate, the Legion Go offers a stunning visual experience. Despite its size, the control layout is so comfortable that you'll get lost in your favorite games without even realizing it.

üöÄ **Powerful Performance:**
Under the hood, the Legion Go houses the powerful AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU. With 8 cores, 16 threads, and a clock speed of up to 5.1 GHz, this machine is ready to challenge your expectations. Additionally, the fast 7500 mega transfers per second RAM makes a noticeable difference in performance. [Buy on Amazon](https://geni.us/9gqnR)

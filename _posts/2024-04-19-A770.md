3. **Can a 750W power supply keep the Arc A770 lit?**
Absolutely! The A770 is a power-efficient dude. A good quality 750W PSU will be your trusty squire, providing ample juice for the card and your other components.

4. **Can the Arc A770 conquer 4K?**
It depends on your quest, brave adventurer! The A770 can handle 4K at medium settings in many games. But for the smoothest, highest-fidelity experience at 4K, you might need a more powerful GPU. [Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3JoEBwL)

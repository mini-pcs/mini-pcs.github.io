As we dive into the world of mini PCs, it's exciting to see new innovations emerge. The ASUS PN64 is one such device that brings a big boost in performance, thanks to its Intel and AMD H processor. Let's take a closer look at what this powerful mini PC has to offer! üíª

**Design and Build Quality: A Step Up from the Past üèóÔ∏è**

The PN64 boasts a larger design compared to its predecessor, the PN50. However, it's not just about size; the build quality is where we see significant improvements. The plastic construction feels solid and sturdy, making it a great option for those who want a reliable mini PC.

**Opening and Disassembling: A Challenge Worth Overcoming üîß**

While the design has improved, opening and disassembling the PN64 can be a bit tricky. Be prepared to wrestle with the bottom lid, as it might get stuck. Additionally, the ribbon cable inside can be quite finicky, so be gentle when handling it.

**Performance: A Beast of a CPU üí™**

The PN64 is equipped with an Intel Core i5 processor, which delivers impressive results in single-core and multi-core benchmarks. It's clear that Intel's new generation of CPUs has given the PN64 a significant performance boost.

**Memory and Storage: Easy to Upgrade üìà**

Adding memory and storage is a breeze on the PN64. With its expandable RAM and storage options, you can easily upgrade your device to meet your growing needs.

**Emulation: A Mixed Bag üéÆ**

When it comes to emulation, the PN64 has some mixed results. While it can handle most consoles up to the Wii U with ease, PS3 games might experience graphical glitches or crashes. It's not the best option for serious emulators, but it still gets the job done.

**Power Draw: A Consistent Performance üí°**

The PN64's power draw is consistent, reaching a maximum of almost 100C. While this may lead to thermal and power throttling under load, it's essential to consider how you plan to use your device.

**Warranty: Room for Improvement üìù**

Unfortunately, the warranty offered by ASUS is quite stingy compared to its competitors. If you're looking for a reliable mini PC with a comprehensive warranty, you might want to explore other options.

**Conclusion: A Great Option for Those Who Want Power üí•**

The ASUS PN64 is an excellent choice for those who prioritize performance and build quality. While it has some drawbacks, such as the opening and disassembling process, its impressive CPU capabilities make it a great option for anyone looking for a powerful mini PC.
